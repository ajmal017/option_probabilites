# Estimating Option-Implied Probability Distributions for Equity Pricing
The main goal of this project is to forecast the different price target probabilities of equity which will help to quantify the uncertainty associated with it. Call and put options on an asset are influenced by how the market believes a certain asset will perform in the future and this program tries to capture the sentiment and give probabilities to different prices.
